# Key Features

MapFlow is packed with features designed for professional VJs and projection mapping artists. This guide provides an overview of the core capabilities.

## 1. Modular Node System

MapFlow uses a powerful node-based architecture that gives you complete control over your signal flow.

*   **Flexible Routing**: Connect any source to any effect or output.
*   **Reusability**: Create complex effect chains and reuse them across different layers.
*   **Visual Programming**: See exactly how your video data is flowing and being processed.

## 2. Advanced Projection Mapping

MapFlow excels at mapping video onto complex physical surfaces.

*   **Mesh Warping**: Use grid-based warping to fit video onto curved or irregular shapes.
*   **Keystone Correction**: Quickly align projections with 4-point corner pinning.
*   **Masking**: Draw custom masks (Bezier curves) to hide unwanted parts of the projection.
*   **Edge Blending**: Seamlessly blend multiple projectors to create a single, large image.

## 3. Media Playback

A robust media engine ensures smooth playback of high-resolution content.

*   **Wide Format Support**: Playback of H.264, H.265 (HEVC), VP8, VP9, and ProRes video.
*   **HAP Codec**: Native support for the HAP codec family for high-performance, GPU-accelerated playback.
*   **Image Sequences**: Support for folders of images (PNG, JPG) played back as video.
*   **GIF Animation**: Full support for animated GIFs with variable frame delays.

## 4. Real-time Effects

Enhance your visuals with a suite of GPU-accelerated effects.

*   **Shader Graph**: Create custom effects using a visual node editor. No coding required!
*   **Built-in Effects**: Includes Blur, Color Correction, Distortion, Pixelate, and more.
*   **Post-Processing**: Apply global effects to the final output.

## 5. Audio Reactivity

Make your visuals dance to the music.

*   **FFT Analysis**: Real-time frequency analysis breaks audio into bands (Bass, Mid, High).
*   **Beat Detection**: Automatic BPM detection and beat synchronization.
*   **Audio Triggers**: Use audio levels to drive any parameter (e.g., scale a layer based on bass volume).

## 6. Control Integration

MapFlow integrates seamlessly with your hardware and software setup.

*   **MIDI**: Full two-way MIDI support. Map knobs and faders to any parameter. Includes presets for popular controllers (e.g., Ecler NUO 4).
*   **OSC**: Open Sound Control support for remote control from tablets or other software.
*   **NDI**: Send and receive high-quality video over the network.
*   **Spout / Syphon**: Share textures in real-time with other applications on the same computer (Spout on Windows, Syphon on macOS).

## 7. Multi-Output Support

*   **Multiple Displays**: Drive multiple projectors or screens from a single computer.
*   **Virtual Outputs**: Output to NDI or Spout for recording or streaming.
*   **Color Calibration**: Fine-tune color and gamma for each output independently.

## 8. Bevy Particles Node

Generate dynamic particle systems directly within MapFlow.

*   **Real-time Simulation**: GPU-accelerated particle simulation using Bevy engine.
*   **Audio Reactive**: Control particle emission rate, speed, and color with audio triggers.
*   **Customizable**: Adjust lifetime, speed, and color gradients to match your visual style.
*   **Performance**: Lightweight implementation designed for high frame rates.
