# Lina StyleUI Journal

## 2024-05-23 - Initialization

**Learning:** The project aims for a "Resolume" inspired Cyber Dark theme but lacks a dedicated UI journal.
**Action:** Created this journal to track visual improvements and theme consistency.

## 2024-05-23 - Layer Panel Legibility

**Learning:** The Layer Panel lacked visual hierarchy. Layers were just floating text, making long lists hard to scan.
**Action:** Implemented alternating row colors ("Zebra Striping") using `theme::colors::DARKER_GREY` and added a `CYAN_ACCENT` stroke for selected items to improve contrast and focus, mimicking the Resolume card style.
